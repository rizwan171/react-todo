## About <a name = "about"></a>
Here we have my todo list application. Built with React.js, this was my first introductory project to the framework.

###General functionality includes:
- Adding Todos
- Removing Todos
- Filtering Todos on completion status

The initial todo list is populated with 5 results from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos. Along with this being my first React project, this was the first time I used the Fetch API to consume an API.

###Core Concepts:
- React.js State and Props
- Splitting web documents into components
- Handling events between parent and child components
- Async/Await for Fetch promises

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Basic terminal knowledge

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone this repository
2. In the root directory, run ```npm install``` to install the required dependencies
3. Once that is complete, run ```npm start``` to start the app locally. This should typically start on http://localhost:3030
